Is the README format in 1.1 better where there's hints under each code section, or 1.5 where there's an explicit TODO over each code section?

Should we use es6 syntax?

We want to use the airbnb javascript syntax right?



## Wrapping up
(somewhat subjective stuff that might have to wait until the chapters 1-3 are drafted)
- add a formatting/syntax guide to the initial dev setup README
- make sure that the english grammar is concise and readable (READMEs, code comments, etc...)
- make sure all READMEs, tests, and coding challenges follow the same format
- publish to website and merge my fork of the code repo to the main code repo
