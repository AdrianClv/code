> The code challenges in this course build upon each other. It's highly recommended that you start from the beginning. If you haven't already, get started with our [Installation Instructions](https://www.burrrata.ch/ces-website/docs/en/sync/dev-env-setup).

> ! The chapter 3 coding challenges use a network simulation. This is created by nodeAgent.js and networkSim.js in the `ch3` directory. You do not need to understand how this network simulation works to complete the chapter two coding challenges, but we highly recommend it. The README in the `ch3` directory will give you a high level overview of the network demo. Each file also has detailed code comments explaining how each function works.
