# Questions

Is the README format in 1.1 better where there's hints under each code section, or 1.5 where there's an explicit TODO over each code section?

Should we use es6 syntax?

We want to use the airbnb javascript syntax right?



# Ch1 TODO List

1.4
- refactor UTXO coding challenge
- update 1.4 README to reflect refactor
- create demo

Tests
- update 1.2 tests
- write 1.3 tests
- write 1.4 tests
- write 1.5 tests

Formatting
- make sure there are no references to TX (only Tx to keep consistency and camel-case-ability)
- make all javascript file names lowercase



# Ch1 DONE List

DEMOS
- update 1.2 demo
- write 1.3 demo
- write 1.5 demo

READMEs
- update 1.1 README
- update 1.2 README
- write 1.3 README
- update 1.5 README

Formatting
- get ALE and prettier/eslint working so that it's easy to catch errors and format the code

1.2 Refactor
- refactor Paypal.js to separate functions to check code, apply tx, and process tx (check, apply, check pending) so that it flows better into 1.3
- rewrite TODO sections so that they have a consistent formatting (1.2 and 1.3 are not the same)

1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 code challenges

Removed FTPaypal from 1.5 because it doesn't seem legit. It's better as a README item than a piece of code because it doesn't really do anything. Code should do stuff.
