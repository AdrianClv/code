# Questions

Is the README format in 1.1 better where there's hints under each code section, or 1.5 where there's an explicit TODO over each code section?

Should we use es6 syntax?

We want to use the airbnb javascript syntax right?



# Ch1 TODO List

Formatting
- make sure there are no swap files that are lingering in the section folders
- make sure there are no english language typos
- make sure that the english grammar is concise and readable (READMEs, code comments, etc...)
- make sure there are no references to TX (only Tx to keep consistency and camel-case-ability)
- add a formatting/syntax guide to the initial dev setup README

Formatting TODO
- 1.3
- 1.4
- 1.5

Wrapping up
- make sure that all tests are set to test the student code vs the solutions
- make sure all READMEs, tests, and coding challenges follow the same format
- publish to website and merge my fork of the code repo to the main code repo



# Ch1 DONE List

Formatting
- make all javascript file names lowercase

Formatting
- 1.1
- 1.2

1.4
- create a README that introduces the student to the tutorial, then let them know it's optional as a "bonus" item, but not critical to understanding the rest of the course

Tests
- refactor 1.2 tests
- refactor 1.3 tests
- refactor 1.5 tests

DEMOS
- update 1.2 demo
- write 1.3 demo
- write 1.5 demo

READMEs
- update 1.1 README
- update 1.2 README
- write 1.3 README
- update 1.5 README

Formatting
- get ALE and prettier/eslint working so that it's easy to catch errors and format the code

1.2 Refactor
- refactor Paypal.js to separate functions to check code, apply tx, and process tx (check, apply, check pending) so that it flows better into 1.3
- rewrite TODO sections so that they have a consistent formatting (1.2 and 1.3 are not the same)

1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 code challenges

Removed FTPaypal from 1.5 because it doesn't seem legit. It's better as a README item than a piece of code because it doesn't really do anything. Code should do stuff.
