get ALE and prettier/eslint working so that it's easy to catch errors and format the code

make sure all TX are Tx
- figure out how to run a case sensitive search and replace in VIM

make sure that every single branch of every function is run in demo.js and/or run as a mocha test




move Client.js, Paypal.js, and demo.js to the `solution` folder

rewrite the files in the `1.3` folder to just have code comments and todo items

write mocha tests for everything (yes I know... should've done that as I was going, but I didn't know what the architecture needed to look like until I was done anyways)

make sure that 1.2 flows into 1.3




NOTE
- the readme is not done yet, but I think it makes sense to get all the code for the chapter written FIRST, then write the readmes explaining the code

Question: why are the files titled with an upper-case letter?
- lowercase seems easier
