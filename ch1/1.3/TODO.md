get ALE and prettier/eslint working so that it's easy to catch errors and format the code

make sure all TX are Tx
- figure out how to run a case sensitive search and replace in VIM

make sure that every single branch of every function is run in demo.js and/or run as a mocha test





rewrite the files in the `1.3` folder to just have code comments and todo items
- for the demo, it actually might make more sense to NOT have it commented out, that way the student is guided by an idea of what/how the program is supposed to work
- this would make the main purpose of demo.js to guide the student and help them visualize the code vs being another challenge (which I think is the right way to go since we're introducing a lot more complexity into the code challenges now)
-
-

write mocha tests for everything (yes I know... should've done that as I was going, but I didn't know what the architecture needed to look like until I was done anyways)

make sure that 1.2 flows into 1.3




NOTE
- the readme is not done yet, but I think it makes sense to get all the code for the chapter written FIRST, then write the readmes explaining the code

Question: why are the files titled with an upper-case letter?
- lowercase seems easier
